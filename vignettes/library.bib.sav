spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology has been applied to the exploration of biomarkers for
early cancer diagnosis, but more effort is required to identify a single sensitive and specific
biomarker. For early diagnosis, a proteomic profile is the gold standard, but inconvenient for
clinical use since the profile peaks are quantitative. It would therefore be helpful to find a
minimized profile, comprising fewer peaks than the original using an existing algorithm and
compare it with other traditional statistical methods.},
