The figure label is generated from the code chunk label by prefixing it with `fig:`.\n\n```{r plot, fig.cap=\"Regular figure. The first sentence of the figure caption is automatically emphasized to serve as figure title.\", echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nSmall and wide figures can be specified by `fig.small` and `fig.wide` code chunk options.\n\n```{r small, fig.cap=\"Small figure. A plot produced by a code chunk with option `fig.small = TRUE`.\", fig.small=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\n```{r wide, fig.cap=\"Wide figure. A plot produced by a code chunk with option `fig.wide = TRUE`.\", fig.wide=TRUE, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\n\n# Equations\n\nTo number and reference equations, put them in equation environments and assign labels to them, see Equation \\@ref(eq:binom).\n\n\\begin{equation}\n  f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\n  (\\#eq:binom)\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n# Tables\n\nLike figures, tables with captions will also be numbered and can be referenced, see Table \\@ref(tab:table).\n\nFruit   | Price\n------- | -----\nbananas | 1.2\napples  | 1.0\noranges | 2.5\n\n: (\\#tab:table) A simple table. With caption.\n\n\n# Cross-references\n\nApart from referencing figures (Section \\@ref(figures)), tables (Section \\@ref(tables)), and equations (Section \\@ref(equations)), you can also use the same syntax to refer to sections by their default labels generated by pandoc.\n\n\n# Side notes\n\nFootnotes are displayed as side notes on the right margin^[this is a side note entered as a footnote], which has the advantage that they appear close to the place where they are defined.\n\n\n# Session info {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n",
